    "text": "The data set we were working with was the “US Healthcare Spending Per Capita” (source: Dept of Health and Human Services). After completing the initial review and exploratory analysis using a few “top level” R commands and some basic plots we began further analysis. This analysis focused on the questions of how health care costs changed over the time span of 2005 to 2014, as well as what some of the trends were related to the data provided. After looking into these questions, we spent some time with the most recent year available within the data set looking into similar concerns, but at a more regional and local level. With this review and analysis, we were able to discern that health care costs at the personal level had risen over the indicated time spans and that some areas within the United states have drastically different health care costs."

    "text": "1a. Since 2005 have healthcare costs increased/decreased/stayed the same (or something else)?\n\nWith this question in mind and the review of the exploratory analysis performed above we should make the assumption that healthcare costs increased between 2005 and 2014.\n\nWe should be able to test this assumption by looking at the ‘Personal Health Care’ data over time since it is a summation of all other ‘Items’. To do this this we will need to pivot the data to allow for listing of all costs for all years categorized to a single column.\n\nhcs2005_long <- hcs2005 %>% \n  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"y\"), names_to = \"year\",\n              names_prefix = \"y\", values_to = \"cost_in_millions\",\n              values_drop_na = TRUE)\n\n\n \n\nWe will further need to convert the newly created ‘year’ column to date format.\n\nhcs2005_long$year <- substring(hcs2005_long$year, 2)\n\nhcs2005_long$year <- ISOdate(hcs2005_long$year, 1, 1) \n\n\n \n\nNow that our data is cleaned up we can create the scatter plot and add the linear regression line for analysis.\n\nhcs2005_long %>% filter(Item == \"Total\", Region_Name == \"United States\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=cost_in_millions))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\", se=FALSE)+\n  labs(x=\"Year\", y=\"Total Health Care Cost\", title=\"Total 2005-2014 US health care costs\")+\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nLooking at the line in our plot above we can easily see that the healthcare costs in the United States as a whole have increased between 2005 and 2014. Not only have they increased, but as shown, the costs have risen at a drastic rate.\n\n \n\n\nWith consideration of the information gained from the plot(s) above we can state that our Null Hypothesis is that as time increases personal healthcare costs remain the same. This in turn leads us to our state that our Alternate Hypothesis is that personal health care increases as time progresses.\n\n\n \n\nFor curiosity sake, let’s add in the models for each individual ‘Item’ group.\n\nhcs2005_long %>% filter(Region_Name == \"United States\" & \n                          Item != \"Total\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=log(cost_in_millions), color=Item))+\n    geom_point()+\n    geom_smooth(method=\"lm\", se=FALSE)+\n      theme_minimal()+\n      theme(legend.position=\"bottom\")+\n      scale_color_discrete(guide=guide_legend(nrow=3), name=\"Type\")+\n      labs(x=\"Year\", y=\"Total Health Care Cost (log)\", \n           title=\"Total 2005-2014 US health care costs per type of expense\")\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nLooking at the plot above we can easily see that the healthcare costs in all categories for the United States as a whole have increased between 2005 and 2014. But we should test this further to be sure.\n\n \n\nLet’s look at fitting the linear regression model.\n\nhcs2005us <- hcs2005_long %>% filter(Item == \"Total\", \n                                     Region_Name == \"United States\")\n\nmod2005 <- lm(hcs2005us$cost_in_millions~hcs2005us$year)\n\nsummary(mod2005)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = hcs2005us$cost_in_millions ~ hcs2005us$year)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-27010  -7094   1879  11964  22934 \n\nCoefficients:\n                 Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    \n(Intercept)    -1.530e+06  7.573e+04  -20.20 3.77e-08 ***\nhcs2005us$year  2.942e-03  6.059e-05   48.55 3.58e-11 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 17370 on 8 degrees of freedom\nMultiple R-squared:  0.9966,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.9962 \nF-statistic:  2357 on 1 and 8 DF,  p-value: 3.584e-11\n\n\nFrom the data above provided by our summary we can see, under “Coefficients”, the column labeled “Estimate” gives us a Y-intercept of -1.530e+06 and the coefficient for the independent variable year. With this information we can generate our equation for the regression line:\nCost = 0.002942*(year)\nThe p-value is shown as 3.584e-11 which indicates that the association is statistically significant as it is much less than 0.05 indicating that our Null Hypothesis should be rejected.\n\nWith consideration of our initial question: Since 2005 have healthcare costs increased/decreased/stayed the same (or something else), we can conclude that:\n\n\nThe assumption that healthcare costs increased between 2005 and 2014 is true. This is backed up by our t-test hypothesis testing where we stated that our Null Hypothesis was that as time increases personal healthcare costs remain the same. We also stated that our Alternate Hypothesis was that as time increases so does personal healthcare costs.\n\n\nSimply put, we have confidence that, since 2005, healthcare costs have increased."

Let’s start with a basic bar charts and look, once again, at the United States as a whole.\n\nhcs2005_long %>% \n  filter(Group == \"United States\" & Item != \"Total\") %>% \n    ggplot(aes(x = Item, y = log(cost_in_millions))) +\n      geom_col(fill=\"orange\") +\n      coord_flip()+\n      theme_minimal()+\n      labs(x=\"Tyoe of expense\", y=\"Total Health Care Cost (log)\", \n          title=\"Total US health care costs per type of expense\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe basic bar chart shown above gives a good picture of the various costs but let’s look at how this fared each year. We can do this with another bar chart, but with the additional factor of year.\n\nhcs2005_long %>% \n  filter(Group == \"United States\" & Item != \"Total\") %>% \n    ggplot(aes(x = year, y = cost_in_millions, fill = Item)) +\n      geom_col(position = \"dodge\")+\n        theme_minimal()+\n        theme(legend.position=\"bottom\")+\n        scale_fill_discrete(guide=guide_legend(nrow=3), name=\"Type\")+\n        labs(x=\"Year\", y=\"Total Health Care Cost\", \n             title=\"Total 2005-2014 health care costs per type of expense\")\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRemembering that our question for this problem was what categories have dominated healthcare spending, we can see from the simple bar graph above that hospital care dominated the healthcare spending by a large factor. Beyond hospital care, physician and clinical serveries and prescription drugs were the other leading expenditures. The second graph shows us that this trend continued virtually every year between 2005 and 2014 with only a few exceptions. The top two expenses, hospital and physician care, made up more than 50% of all health care costs every year."

Since 2005, is there a regional trend with respect to healthcare spending?\n\n \n\nIn order to determine the trend within each region and compare all regions to each other we will need to make an individual plot for each one. We can accomplish this in a nice fashion by utilizing a facet wrap layout.\n\nhcs2005_long %>% filter(Region_Name != \"United States\") %>% \nggplot(aes(x = year, y = cost_in_millions, fill=Region_Name)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  facet_wrap(vars(Region_Name))+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))+\n    labs(x=\"Year\", y=\"Total Health Care Cost\", \n         title=\"Comparison of 2005-2014 total regional health care costs\")\n\n\n\n\n\nIn comparison to one another we see some interesting facts. As shown by the heights of each bar within each plot the Southwest part of the United States typically have the highest healthcare costs. The second most expensive region for healthcare costs is the Mideast region with the Far West and Great Lakes regions following close behind having similar expenses between them. New England and the Plains are also close to each other rounding out the regions just above the Rocky Mountains which has the lowest healthcare costs in the nation. From the individual plots we can easily see the trends for each region. Looking at the individual regions we see the trend for each of them is an increase in costs year by year.\n\n\nWe can verify this conclusion by looking at the average personal healthcare costs as a whole across each region. Let’s use a box plot for an alternate view.\n\nhcs2005_long %>% filter(Group == \"Region\" & (Item == \"Total\" &\n                        Region_Name != \"United States\")) %>% \n  group_by(year) %>% \n    summarise(avgCost=mean(cost_in_millions), sdCost=sd(cost_in_millions), n=n())\n\n\nhcs2005_long %>% filter(Group == \"Region\" & (Item == \"Total\" & Region_Name != \"United States\")) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(Region_Name, -cost_in_millions), y=cost_in_millions, group=Region_Name, color=Region_Name))+\n  geom_boxplot()+\n    theme_minimal()+\n    scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log\")+\n    coord_flip()+\n    labs(x=\"Region\", y=\"Total Health Care Cost\", \n         title=\"Comparison of total regional health care costs\", color=\"Region\")\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nIndeed, this confirms our interpretation of the differences in costs by region trend."
