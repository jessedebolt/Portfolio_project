My name is Jesse DeBolt and I am a skilled manufacturing engineer with over 20 years of experience in various manufacturing settings. While working at my previous employer, I had the opportunity to work with different business data in a cost estimation capacity. This experience sparked my interest in data sciences and prompted me to begin learning SQL techniques, data mining, and analysis.\n\nAfter leaving my previous role due to a plant closure, I decided to pursue a masterâ€™s degree in data science with a focus on data engineering, analysis, visualization, and data communication. I am set to graduate in August 2023 and am actively seeking professional opportunities to utilize my newly acquired knowledge.\n\nAside from my passion for data science, I enjoy hiking, listening to music, and working on home improvement and remodel projects. I am a friendly and approachable individual who values professionalism and collaboration in the workplace. I am excited to apply my expertise and work alongside other professionals to achieve mutual success.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":true,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","theme":"superhero","title":"Jesse A.
