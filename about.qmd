As an accomplished engineer with a proven track record in project management and continuous improvement, I've always been driven by a passion for optimizing processes and enhancing performance. My journey in engineering has been diverse and fulfilling, further enriched by a now-completed Master of Science degree in data science.  

Throughout my career, I've shown strong leadership and project management skills. I've managed diverse teams across multiple disciplines and various organizations, always fostering collaboration and spearheading continuous improvement projects. My contributions were crucial in developing a cost system configurator and costing database tool that had a transformative effect on product selection and cost estimation in my organization.  

I strongly advocate for cross-functional collaboration. I make it a point to work closely with both internal departments and external suppliers to ensure we're aligned on design and quality requirements, and that we meet our production milestones. I excel at maintaining key performance indicators (KPIs) and am adept at delivering valuable management insights through accurate reporting.  

My pursuit of operational excellence has led me to engineer innovative solutions with tangible results. For example, my leadership in developing a routing generator tool significantly reduced the lead time for generating shop floor routings, resulting in substantial cost savings. Using methodologies like Value Stream Mapping, 5S, Ishikawa, and A3 (PDCA), I have been able to drive continuous improvement initiatives that have left a lasting impact.  

Outside of work, I'm a dedicated family man and love spending time outdoors. I enjoy camping and hiking adventures with my spouse and three sons, and I'm always up for a home remodel or improvement project. Additionally, I'm deeply committed to raising mental health awareness and advocacy. I see a significant overlap between data science and mental health and am eager to leverage my skills to contribute to research and initiatives in this space.  

Educationally, I have a solid foundation with a Bachelor of Science degree in Manufacturing Engineering from the Oregon Institute of Technology. My technical skill set is extensive, including proficiency in MS Office Products, SAP ERP system, Python and R programming, and SQL. I specialize in data visualization and have a proven ability to glean meaningful insights from intricate datasets.  

Mentoring and sharing knowledge is something that brings me immense satisfaction. My dedication to fostering growth has earned me a reputation as a dependable mentor, one who is always eager to provide guidance and support.  

In summary, I'm an experienced engineer and a devoted student of data science, combining technical skills, leadership qualities, and a down-to-earth approach in all that I do. I believe in the power of teamwork, the value of continuous improvement, and the importance of robust engineering solutions. As I look forward to the next phase of my career, I'm committed to further honing my skills and contributing to sustainable, long-term success wherever I go.
