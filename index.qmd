Hello, I'm Jesse DeBolt. After dedicating more than 20 years to manufacturing engineering, I've taken a decisive step to further augment my expertise. Driven by an insatiable curiosity for problem-solving and continuous improvement, I recently explored the fascinating world of data science. Having graduated with a Master's in Data Science, I am keen to explore roles that allow me to blend my engineering experience with data-driven decision-making. I am open to new and exciting career possibilities and look forward to contributing my newly acquired skills to a dynamic team.
