::: callout-note
The intent of the project below was to find a Tidy Tuesday Challenge submission and recreate it and in some way expand, extend, or deviate from the original.

The original inspiration was from the [#TidyTuesday Challenge submission](https://twitter.com/ryanahart/status/1618685056033366016/photo/1 "#TidyTuesday | Week 4 | Alone") by [Ryan Hart](https://twitter.com/ryanahart/status/1618685056033366016/photo/1 "Twitter: @ryanahart").
