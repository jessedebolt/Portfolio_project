Hi there! My name is Jesse DeBolt and I am a skilled manufacturing engineer with over 20 years of experience in various manufacturing settings. While working at my previous employer, I had the opportunity to work with different business data in a cost estimation capacity. This experience sparked my interest in data sciences and prompted me to begin learning SQL techniques, data mining, and analysis.

After leaving my previous role due to a plant closure, I decided to pursue a masterâ€™s degree in data science with a focus on data engineering, analysis, visualization, and data communication. I am set to graduate in August 2023 and am actively seeking professional opportunities to utilize my newly acquired knowledge.

Aside from my passion for data science, I enjoy hiking, listening to music, and working on home improvement and remodel projects. I am a friendly and approachable individual who values professionalism and collaboration in the workplace. I am excited to apply my expertise and work alongside other professionals to achieve mutual success.
